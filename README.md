# MyDemo
Learning ASP.NET MVC 5 with some experimentation and random features to help me learn!

This is a project created purely for the purpose of educating myself. I've used a vast array of different online 
resources to learn these concepts including: Youtube, uDemy, StackOverflow, and w3Schools.

The goal is to have a website where members can post games that can be steam-shared with each other. Obviously, this
can already be seen in Steam, but this is just a simple interface and an excuse to learn some new technology. I'm 
open to criticism and new ideas, but for right now the purpose is purely educational and for fun.
